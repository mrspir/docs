Hey everyone! I’m Spir, the founder of [OriginStake](https://originstake.com "OriginStake"), and also a Blockchain Developer & System Engineer.

I’m starting to draft some training materials for our new team members, and suddenly it hit me: wouldn’t it be awesome to make this available for the whole community? After over three years of diving headfirst into blockchain from scratch, I totally understand the ‘hard-as-a-coconut’ struggle that newcomers face. The confusing terms, mind-bending operations, outdated guides, and sometimes cryptic instructions can leave beginners feeling totally lost and ready to throw in the towel – especially when you know the answers are probably on the internet, but you have no idea what keywords to search for (been there, done that, lol).  

That’s why I want to create a knowledge hub that’s clear, simple, structured, and easy to navigate. Partly so everyone can easily look up and learn, and partly to inspire my team at OriginStake and myself to keep pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and culture of sharing.  

Alongside building this knowledge portal, I’m constantly learning new things, testing ideas, and experimenting, so you might notice changes and updates here and there. Hopefully, that won’t drive you too crazy!
