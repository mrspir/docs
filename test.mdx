## Huobi exchange overview

Huobi is a cryptocurrency exchange founded by Leon Li in September 2013. Huobi's headquarters is in Beijing, China - one of the "promised lands" of the financial and banking sector. In the early years of its establishment, the Houbi exchange was oriented only to developing domestic operations under the management of the government.

All services have been invested a lot, aiming to meet the highest needs of cryptocurrency and related asset trading people. The name Huobi has quickly become one of the top crypto trading brands in China.
